##### A funny story

When I was traveling in SE Asia me and 2 friends bought some old motorcycles to ride in Cambodja.
It was rain season and my friend was not used to riding. So when we had to cross a railway which was on a small hill he got stuck in the mud. His first reflex was to give full throttle and ofcourse that worked really well. He flew over the railway and almost hit a cow. 

Friend and Cow were okay!

###### TL;DR
> Friend did a amazing stunt on a motorcycle.
